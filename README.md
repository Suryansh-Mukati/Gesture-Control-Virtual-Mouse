# Gesture-Control-Virtual-Mouse
"Gesture Control Virtual Mouse" This project uses hand gesture to control your mouse.
Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures. The computer requires almost no direct contact. All i/o operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures. This project makes use of the state-of-art Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures and voice commands, which works smoothly without any additional hardware requirements. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by MediaPipe running on top of pybind11. It consists of two modules: One which works direct on hands by making use of MediaPipe Hand detection, and other which makes use of Gloves of any uniform color. Currently it works on Windows platform.

Note: Use Python version: 3.8.5
